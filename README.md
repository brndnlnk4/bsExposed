File content to another project of mine. Warning: this project is a bit heavy and demanding so I depending on CPU power the page output peformance may vary 
This is some of the main code I provided to one of my projects. 

I should probably start using OOP but I find it to slow my machine down due to the extra memory allocation.(I dont have much RAM to work with) lol
